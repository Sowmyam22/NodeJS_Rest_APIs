# NodeJS_Rest_APIs

## REST Concepts & Ideas

1. REST API is all about Data, no UI logic is exchanged.
2. REST APIs are normal node servers which expose different end points (Http method + path) for clients to send request to.
3. JSON is a common Data format that is used both for requests and responses.
4. REST APIs are decoupled from the clients that use them.


## Request & Responses

1. Attach Data in JSON format and let other end know by setting the 'Content-Type' header.
2. CORS errors occur when using an API that does not set CORS headers.
